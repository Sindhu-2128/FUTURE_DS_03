# College Event Feedback Analysis
## Project Overview

This project analyzes student feedback data collected after a college event to evaluate satisfaction across academic and non-academic aspects. The goal is to identify strengths, highlight improvement areas, and derive actionable insights using data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Dataset

- Source: Kaggle

- Type: Student feedback survey data

- Records: 181 responses

- Features: Teaching, Course Content, Examination, Lab Work, Library Facilities, Extracurricular Activities

Note: Feedback scores are encoded as

1 → Positive

0 → Neutral

-1 → Negative

## Tools & Technologies

- Python

- Pandas

- Matplotlib

- Seaborn

- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow

- Loaded and explored the feedback dataset

- Cleaned and standardized column names

- Removed duplicate and missing values

- Separated numeric feedback scores for analysis

- Calculated average satisfaction scores per category

- Created multiple visualizations to analyze patterns

- Interpreted results and derived business insights

## Visualizations Included

- Teaching feedback score distribution

- Average student feedback score by category

- Overall student satisfaction distribution

- Positive, neutral, and negative feedback comparison

- Category-wise feedback ranking

- Correlation heatmap between feedback categories

## Key Insights

- Extracurricular activities received the highest student satisfaction scores

- Teaching quality shows strong positive feedback, indicating effective faculty performance

- Lab work and library facilities have comparatively lower scores, suggesting areas for improvement

- Academic-related parameters are rated higher than infrastructure-related facilities

## Conclusion

The analysis highlights that while overall student satisfaction is positive, targeted improvements in infrastructure and practical learning facilities can significantly enhance future event experiences. The insights derived can help institutions make data-driven decisions to improve student engagement and satisfaction.
